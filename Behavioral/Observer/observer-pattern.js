/**
 * The observer pattern lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they are observing. Basically, it's like having an event listener on a given object, and when that object perfoms the action we're listening for, we do something.
 * 
 * Simple example is useEffect hook in React
