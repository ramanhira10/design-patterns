/**
 * The proxy pattern provides a substitue or a placeholder for another object. The idea is to control access to the original object, performing some kind of action before or after the request gets to the actual original object.
 * 
 * A simple example is Middlewares in ExpressJS. Middlewares are nothing more than pieces of code we can make execute before, in the middle or after any request reaches our endpoints.
